# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Issue: Unexpected Div Width and Spacing

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's flexbox utilities.  The problem arises from a lack of explicit width constraints or flex-related properties on the parent container, leading to unexpected behavior of the flex items.

## Bug Description
Two divs, each with a background color and padding, are placed within a flex container.  Without proper configuration of the parent, the divs might not occupy the expected width or spacing.

## Solution
The solution involves adding width constraints to the parent container or using Tailwind's flexbox utilities to control the item width and spacing.  This ensures the divs are rendered correctly.
