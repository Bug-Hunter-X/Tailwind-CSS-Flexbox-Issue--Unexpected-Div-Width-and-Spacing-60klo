```javascript
<div class="flex w-full">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```
This corrected code sets the width of the parent container to `w-full` (100% of its parent's width) and also specifies `w-1/2` (50% width) for each div. This ensures the divs are displayed side by side and fill the available space evenly.
