```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style two divs within a flex container.  However, the divs might not render as expected, particularly in regards to their width and spacing, if the parent container doesn't have explicit width constraints or flex-related properties set.
